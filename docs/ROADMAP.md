# canvas — Roadmap

`canvas` is **L1** of the GUI stack. The first milestone is bounded by the
**desktop counter app** (the first vertical slice that proves the whole stack
end-to-end with `quiver`).

## Milestone 0 — scaffold ✅ (current)

- `Ruxen.toml` (library + `[system_libs]` for SDL2/Skia).
- API skeleton: `Window`, `Canvas`, `Color`, `Rect`, `Event`.
- `runtime/skia_shim.c` C-shim placeholder.
- Design docs.

## Milestone 1 — minimal canvas FFI (counter-app slice) ✅ (software backend)

The smallest canvas surface that lets `quiver` render and run a counter,
implemented over the deterministic software raster backend (the exact
`ruxen_canvas_*` ABI the GPU backend will use):

1. `Window.open` → framebuffer-backed window (headless; SDL window + GL/
   Metal surface slot in behind the same ABI later). ✅
2. Canvas FFI: `begin_frame` / `end_frame`, `clear(color)`, `draw_rect`,
   `draw_text` (one embedded 5x7 font) + `measure_text` + `read_pixel`. ✅
3. Event stream: pointer move/down/up, scroll, resize, close, **control keys**
   (`KeyDown`) + **printable text** (`TextInput`, via `SDL_TEXTINPUT`) — over a C
   ring buffer with `push_event`/`poll_event`. Windowed pointer coords are mapped
   window-points → design coords by the show factor; windows are resizable and
   emit `Event.Resize` (GPU surface re-created at the new backing size). ✅
4. A pin test per newly-bound method (46 tests across `tests/`). ✅

**Explicitly out of this slice:** mobile/web, the full canvas surface
(paths/images/clips), text shaping/i18n beyond one basic font, packaging.

## Milestone 2 — real Skia raster backend ✅ (in progress on `feat/skia-backend`)

`canvas` now renders with actual Skia, behind the same `ruxen_canvas_*` ABI,
with the software raster kept as a fallback (`docs/SKIA.md`):

1. **Skia brought in by fetch + dlopen, not vendor + link** — `fetch_skia.sh`
   SHA-pins `libSkiaSharp` (the prebuilt Skia behind Avalonia/Uno/MAUI, flat
   `sk_*` C API); the shim `dlopen`s it like SDL2. ✅ **Host-aware:** Linux
   `.so` + macOS universal `.dylib` (`SkiaSharp.NativeAssets.macOS`), both
   SHA-pinned. Skia is now **active locally on macOS arm64**, so the full
   Skia-only surface is pixel-verified on-host (not just the software branch). ✅
2. Skia draws straight into the existing `0xAARRGGBB` framebuffer
   (`sk_surface_new_raster_direct`, `kBGRA_8888`), so the SDL presenter is
   untouched. `clear`, `draw_rect` routed through Skia. ✅
3. Skia-native primitives: `draw_circle`/`stroke_circle`, `draw_round_rect`/
   `stroke_round_rect`, `draw_rrect`/`stroke_rrect` (per-corner radii),
   `draw_line` — the building blocks for quiver widgets. ✅
4. Antialiased Skia text (`draw_text`/`measure_text`/`text_height`). ✅
5. `skia_available?` / `skia_active?` capability probes; Skia-only ops return a
   clear `Err` when the library is absent. ✅

**Next in this cycle:** gradients (`sk_shader`) + drop-shadows
(`sk_imagefilter`/`sk_maskfilter`) — APIs confirmed present in the lib;
configurable font size/family; then the GPU (Ganesh GL) surface.

## Resolved decisions

- **Skia build/link** — ✅ **fetch prebuilt `libSkiaSharp` + dlopen** (no link,
  no dev package, no source build). See `docs/SKIA.md`.
- **SDL2 vs SDL3** — SDL2 runtime via dlopen for the live-window presenter.

## Open decisions

- _(none currently — the GPU surface backend is decided in `docs/GPU.md`:
  Metal on Apple, OpenGL on Linux/Windows behind one context seam, Vulkan
  deferred. Implementation is a later cycle.)_

## Prod-parity Phase 1 — engine essentials (E1) + desktop services (E2)

The tier that unblocks quiver's animation (F4) and text editing (F3). Each item
is the usual additive 4-step FFI binding + a pin; live-window/GPU paths pin
headless (capability + fallback) and pixel-verify via a standalone
`examples/*_verify.c` where a real window/GPU is required.

### E1 — engine essentials

- [x] **Frame pacing / vsync seam** (ADR: `docs/decisions/frame-pacing.md`). A
      monotonic-ns timebase (`Window#ticks_ns` / `#ticks_ms`,
      `clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC)`), a paced-present wait to an ABSOLUTE
      target tick (`Window#wait_frame` — fills an early frame's slack, never adds
      latency to a late one; no-op-by-design where the Metal/GL present already
      blocks on vsync), and a refresh-rate hint (`Window.refresh_rate` via
      `SDL_GetDesktopDisplayMode`, clean `Err` headless — never a bogus `Ok(0)`).
      NO callback/timer system — just the timebase + paced present, so L2's
      animation ticker has a real timebase. Pins: `tests/frame_pacing.rx`
      (monotonicity, both wait_frame branches, ms=ns/1e6, refresh-rate Err
      contract).
- [x] **Transforms — `skew` + `concat`** (full 2D matrix), composing with the
      existing `save`/`restore`/`translate`/`scale`/`rotate`. `Canvas#skew(sx,sy)`
      (`sk_canvas_skew`) and `Canvas#concat(a,b,c,d,e,f)` (the 6-value top-two-rows
      affine; `sk_canvas_concat`). **Binding gotcha pinned:** this `libSkiaSharp`'s
      `sk_canvas_concat` takes a 4x4 SkM44 in COLUMN-MAJOR order (16 floats), NOT a
      3x3 `sk_matrix_t` — empirically determined via `sk_canvas_get_matrix`
      round-trip (a 3x3 silently no-ops). Pixel-pinned in `tests/canvas_transforms.rx`
      (skew shears a rect into a parallelogram at predicted pixels; concat applies a
      2x-scale + (6,6)-translate matrix and the rect lands in the mapped box).
- [x] **Blend modes** — `Canvas#set_blend_mode(mode)`, a small stable int enum
      (0 src-over / 1 clear / 2 src / 3 multiply / 4 screen) mapped to SkBlendMode
      in the shim (`sk_paint_set_blendmode`). It is host PAINT STATE (Skia paints
      carry the mode), applied to subsequent shape-fill / line / path draws and
      RESET to source-over each `begin_frame` so it never leaks across frames.
      `Canvas.blend_*` constants name the ints. Out-of-range is `Err`. Pixel-pinned
      in `tests/canvas_blend.rx` (multiply red*green→black; screen→yellow;
      per-frame reset; validation).
- [x] **Blur image filter + drop-shadow generalization** — `Canvas#save_layer_blur(sigma)`
      pushes an offscreen layer whose paint carries a Gaussian blur image filter
      (`sk_imagefilter_new_blur` + `sk_paint_set_imagefilter`), so EVERYTHING drawn
      into the layer is blurred when `restore` composites it down. The general blur
      primitive — it blurs arbitrary content (shapes, text, paths), generalizing
      the rrect-only `draw_round_rect_shadow` (frosted panels, blurred backdrops,
      soft shadows of any shape). `sigma <= 0` is `Err`; Skia-only. Pixel-pinned in
      `tests/canvas_blur.rx` (ink spreads past a hard edge under blur; a control
      without the layer keeps the same pixel hard; sigma validation).
- [x] **Dash path effect** — **LANDED in Phase 2. The Phase-1 "blocked" verdict
      was a FALSE NEGATIVE** — it searched for `sk_patheffect_*` (no underscore
      split) + `sk_paint_set_patheffect`, neither of which is SkiaSharp's naming.
      The pinned 3.119.4 `libSkiaSharp` DOES export the path-effect C API under
      `sk_path_effect_*`. Bound on the EXISTING binary (no re-fetch, no new SHA):
      `Canvas#draw_dashed_line(x0,y0,x1,y1,width,on_len,off_len,phase,color)` — an
      [on, off] interval dash with a phase offset. Owned effect created → set on the
      paint → unref'd → paint deleted (no leak). `on_len<=0` / `off_len<0` /
      `width<=0` is `Err`; Skia-only. Pixel-pinned in `tests/canvas_dash.rx`. Full
      re-verdict + symbol table in the Phase 2 section below.

### E2 — desktop services core

- [x] **Clipboard** — `Window.clipboard_text -> Result[String, String]` /
      `Window.set_clipboard_text(s)` via `SDL_GetClipboardText` /
      `SDL_SetClipboardText`. **Works headless** — SDL's clipboard round-trips a
      set->get under the dummy video driver with no live window (verified), so the
      harness pins a REAL round-trip, not just the Err contract. C→Ruxen String
      return uses `ruxen_string_from` (a Ruxen String IS a malloc'd `char*`), so the
      returned text is Ruxen-owned (the SDL copy is `SDL_free`'d); under the forked
      harness the dummy driver is forced for fork-safety (the real Cocoa pasteboard
      is unsafe post-`fork()`). Pinned in `tests/clipboard.rx` (set->get round-trip,
      overwrite replaces, set/get availability agree).
- [x] **IME composition events** — `Event.TextEditing(start, length)` (the
      composition cursor + selection) from `SDL_TEXTEDITING`, the in-progress
      (uncommitted) marked text CJK / diacritic input needs beyond the committed
      `TextInput`. The marked-text STRING is a side-channel: each TextEditing event
      self-carries it in the ring slot (`RxEvent.text[32]`, SDL's composition cap),
      COPIED at push time so no SDL pointer dangles, and read back via
      `Window#composition_text` (a Ruxen-owned String via `ruxen_string_from`)
      right after polling. `Window#push_composition` injects one (carrying the
      string, which plain `push_event` can't); the live SDL pump and a
      `window_pump_test_textediting` seam share the same `push_event_text` path.
      The `Event` variant is APPENDED last so prior tag values stay stable. The
      full sound subset landed (multi-byte CJK round-trip pinned) — no Q-candidate
      needed. Pinned in `tests/ime_editing.rx`.
- [x] **Mouse cursors** — `Window.set_cursor(kind)` over `SDL_CreateSystemCursor`,
      a small int enum (0 arrow / 1 ibeam / 2 hand / 3 crosshair / 4 resize-h /
      5 resize-v; `Window.cursor_*` constants name them). Stock cursors are cached
      per process. `Ok(nil)` on success; `Err` for an out-of-range kind or when SDL
      / a real cursor backend is unavailable (the dummy driver under a fully
      headless host reports "not currently supported" → clean Err, never a crash).
      `Window.cursors_available?` probes the capability. Pinned in
      `tests/cursors.rx` (out-of-range rejection; every valid kind agrees with the
      availability probe — Ok iff available; idempotent re-set; constants). On a
      host with a real display the live cursor path runs in-harness; on a headless
      host the clean-Err branch is asserted — both covered.

## Prod-parity Phase 2 — desktop completeness

> Numbering note (2026-06-11): this section was briefly labeled "Phase 1.5"
> (items deferred out of Phase 1). The stack now uses ONE whole-number phase
> scheme across all repos — canvas Phase 2 runs alongside quiver Phase 2
> (animation + text editing). Items below marked DONE landed in this phase;
> unchecked items are the Phase 2 backlog (or later, where noted).

- [x] **Dash path effect** — **DONE. Re-verdict (2026-06-11): the Phase-1 "binary
      blocked" conclusion was a false negative from searching the WRONG symbol
      name.** Phase-1 ran `nm -gU | grep patheffect` and found nothing, concluding
      the prebuilt lacked the path-effect C API. But SkiaSharp's flat C API spells
      these with an underscore between `path` and `effect`. Re-running `nm -gU` on
      the SAME pinned `~/.cache/ruxen-canvas/libSkiaSharp.dylib` (3.119.4) shows the
      full path-effect surface IS exported:

      | Phase-1 searched (not found) | Actual symbol (PRESENT) |
      |---|---|
      | `sk_patheffect_create_dash` | `sk_path_effect_create_dash` ✅ |
      | `sk_patheffect_unref`       | `sk_path_effect_unref` ✅ |
      | `sk_paint_set_patheffect`   | `sk_paint_set_path_effect` ✅ |

      (the build also exports `sk_path_effect_create_{compose,sum,discrete,corner,
      1d_path,2d_line,2d_path,trim}` — the whole family.) So **no `fetch_skia.sh`
      change, no re-fetch, no new SHA** — dash was bindable on the pinned binary all
      along. Bound as the usual additive 4-step (3 OPTIONAL loader symbols + one
      `ruxen_canvas_draw_dashed_line` shim entry + `Canvas#draw_dashed_line`) with
      the owned-effect lifecycle (create → set-on-paint → unref → delete, no leak)
      and an honest `RXC_ERR_NO_SKIA` if a build ever lacks the symbols. Pixel-pinned
      in `tests/canvas_dash.rx` (on-run inked, off-gap blank, solid-line control).
      **Lesson:** a negative `nm` grep is only as good as the symbol name guessed —
      verify against the C-API header's actual naming before declaring a binary
      blocked.
- [x] **KeyDown modifiers — `Window#key_modifiers` + `Window.mod_*`.** **DONE.**
      `Event.KeyDown` carries the held shift/ctrl/alt/gui state as a side-channel
      (the discipline quiver's selection API waits on). **Append-only:**
      `Event.KeyDown(Int)`'s payload is UNCHANGED — the modifier mask rides a new
      `RxEvent.mods` ring-slot field, read back via `Window#key_modifiers` right
      after polling (like `dropped_file_path` / `composition_text`). The live pump
      reads `SDL_GetModState()` at pump time and folds `KMOD_*` into stable
      `RX_MOD_*` bits; `push_event` / `push_event_text` clear the field so it never
      leaks across events. `Window.mod_shift` / `mod_ctrl` / `mod_alt` / `mod_gui`
      name the bits. Pinned via the extended `window_pump_test_keydown` seam (now
      takes a folded-mask arg) in `tests/key_modifiers.rx`.
- [x] **Render-to-texture / raster cache.** **DONE.** `Canvas#snapshot ->
      Result[Image, String]` copies a canvas's current surface into an immutable
      `Image` via `sk_surface_new_image_snapshot`; the snapshot is then drawn into
      ANY canvas at any offset through the EXISTING `draw_image` path — so the only
      new ABI is the snapshot itself (one shim entry + one loader symbol), reusing
      `Image` / `draw_image` wholesale per the host/raw architecture. **API shape
      chosen:** a standalone offscreen `Canvas.create(w,h)` + `snapshot`, NOT a
      host-level current-target switch — an offscreen raster host already owns its
      own buffer and reuses the entire Canvas draw API for free, so this is the
      least-new-ABI fit. **Ownership:** the snapshot is a COPY (does not alias the
      source pixels — later draws into the source, or dropping it, leave the image
      intact), caller-owned and freed via the SAME `Image` drop path as a loaded
      image (one free path, no double-free). Symbols verified present on the pinned
      `libSkiaSharp.dylib` (`nm -gU`): `sk_surface_new_image_snapshot`,
      `sk_image_unref`, `sk_canvas_draw_image` (all exported). Skia-only — clean
      `Err` on the software-raster fallback. Pixel-pinned in
      `tests/canvas_snapshot.rx` (offscreen red rect at 10,10 → snapshot → blit at
      offset 5,5 → `read_pixel` proves red landed at the offset and the main
      framebuffer stayed pure blue where the image didn't cover; the snapshot stays
      RED after the source is overwritten green).
- [x] **Drag-and-drop (files).** **DONE.** `SDL_DROPFILE` → `Event.FileDrop` (no
      coords — SDL2's file-drop carries no cursor position, and we do not invent
      one). The dropped PATH is a side-channel read via `Window#dropped_file_path`
      right after polling. **Memory contract:** SDL owns the `event.drop.file`
      string (SDL-malloc'd); the pump copies it into the ring at pump time, then
      `SDL_free`s SDL's copy IMMEDIATELY — no SDL pointer ever dangles, the same
      discipline as IME marked text. **But a path is routinely longer than the
      32-byte inline `text` buffer** (which IME uses), so FileDrop gets its OWN
      owned heap copy per ring slot (`RxEvent.drop_path`): push `strdup`s it, poll
      MOVES it into `pending` (freeing the prior one), a non-drop push or host_drop
      frees it — exactly one owner at all times, no truncation, no leak, no
      double-free (verified by the long-path + multi-file pins). The
      `SDL_DropEvent` windowID is at offset 16 (NOT the usual 8) and the path
      pointer at offset 8 — demuxed per window. A multi-file drop arrives as several
      `SDL_DROPFILE` events (one per file); each is handled independently.
      `SDL_EventState(SDL_DROPFILE, SDL_ENABLE)` is called at every window create.
      The `Event` variant is appended LAST (tag 9) so prior tags stay stable. Pins:
      `tests/file_drop.rx` (path round-trip; a >32-byte path intact proving no
      truncation; multi-file FIFO; the FileDrop/TextEditing side-channels stay
      separate; the `window_pump_test_dropfile` seam matches the live handler).
- [x] **File dialogs.** **DONE (macOS).** `Window.open_file_dialog ->
      Result[String, String]` and `Window.save_file_dialog(default_name) ->
      Result[String, String]` drive a real **NSOpenPanel / NSSavePanel** through the
      objc runtime via `dlopen` (`objc_getClass` + `objc_msgSend` to `[NSOpenPanel
      openPanel]` / `[NSSavePanel savePanel]`, foreground-app activation so the modal
      can take key focus, `[panel runModal]`, then `[[panel URL] path].UTF8String`)
      — no new link dependency, the SAME pattern the Metal device path already uses.
      Modal + main-thread (the engine is single-threaded on main, so `runModal` is a
      direct synchronous call). The chosen path returns as a Ruxen-owned String
      (`ruxen_string_from`); cancel / unavailable returns the EMPTY string (never
      NULL), which the Ruxen wrapper maps to `Err` — and `Window.file_dialogs_available?`
      gates the capability. **HONEST-SCOPE — landed subset + the precise remainder:**
      Cocoa is unsafe after `fork()`-without-`exec()` (the same constraint as
      Metal/CF), and the test harness forks per case, so under the harness the
      dialogs are gated OFF (`RUXEN_TEST_FORMAT`, via the shared `rx_window_allowed`
      gate) and return a clean, PROMPT `Err` — never a hang, never a silent no-op,
      never a String from NULL. The LIVE modal needs a real human click, so it is
      proven by the MANUAL `examples/file_dialog_verify.c` (compile-checked, run by a
      human on a desktop), NOT wired into anything automated. The automated bar is
      the headless `Err` pin (`tests/file_dialog.rx`) + the example compiling.
      **Remaining (filed, not blocking):** non-macOS backends (GTK
      `GtkFileChooser` on Linux, `IFileDialog` on Windows) are a later
      platform-matrix item — `file_dialogs_available?` is simply false off macOS
      today, so callers degrade cleanly.
- [x] **Fullscreen / minimize-maximize / DPI-change events.** **DONE.** Per-window
      setters, each resolving its `RxWin` slot by the owning host (multi-window
      correct): `Window#set_fullscreen(on:)` (`SDL_SetWindowFullscreen` with
      `SDL_WINDOW_FULLSCREEN_DESKTOP` — borderless desktop fullscreen, the modern
      no-mode-switch default; the exclusive mode is deliberately not used),
      `#maximize` / `#minimize` / `#restore`, and `#set_min_size(w,h)` /
      `#set_max_size(w,h)`. Each `Ok(nil)` on success; `Err` when the window is not
      shown (`RXC_ERR_PRESENT`) or the SDL entry point is absent (`RXC_ERR_NO_SDL`);
      negative min/max size is `RXC_ERR_BAD_ARGS`. **Pump window-event handling:**
      `SDL_WINDOWEVENT_MINIMIZED` sets a per-slot `minimized` flag (present /
      gl_present / metal_present become no-ops — the **minimized-present contract**:
      an occluded/zero-area drawable is not presented, so the render loop costs
      nothing while minimized); `MAXIMIZED` / `RESTORED` / `DISPLAY_CHANGED` clear it,
      re-derive the backing surface (reusing the existing resize machinery —
      `rx_window_on_resized` → Metal drawable re-query / GL surface invalidate), and
      emit `Event.Resize` in the window's DESIGN size. **DPI/display-change design
      call (greenlit):** no dedicated `DisplayChanged` Event variant — `Event.Resize`
      already carries the design size and triggers exactly the surface re-creation a
      content-scale change needs, so a one-impl variant would add no payload. The
      `Event` enum stays unchanged (no new tag). Pins: `tests/window_mgmt.rx`
      (setters Err-without-window + bad-args; the minimized flag + each subtype's
      Resize emission via the `window_pump_test_window_event` headless seam). Live
      proof: `examples/window_mgmt_verify.c` (`PASS` on a real display —
      fullscreen 320×240→1710×1073, maximize→1710×951, both restores→320×240).
- [x] **Per-window / multi-monitor refresh rate** (Phase-1 `refresh_rate` is
      display-0 only). **DONE.** `Window#refresh_rate -> Result[Int, String]` (an
      INSTANCE method, distinct from the existing static `Window.refresh_rate` which
      stays display-0) reads the rate of the display THIS window sits on:
      `SDL_GetWindowDisplayIndex(win)` picks the window's monitor, then
      `SDL_GetDesktopDisplayMode(thatIndex)` reads its Hz — so a window dragged to a
      144 Hz second monitor reports 144, not the primary's 60. Same Err contract:
      `> 0` → `Ok(hz)`; negative `-RXC_ERR_*` → `Err` when the window is not shown
      (`-PRESENT` — nothing to query the display of) or SDL / the rate is
      unavailable (`-NO_SDL`), never a bogus `Ok(0)`. `SDL_GetWindowDisplayIndex`
      is OPTIONAL — a miss falls back to display 0 (still a valid rate). The forked
      harness opens no real window, so it Errs there; the contract is pinned in
      `tests/frame_pacing.rx` (per-window block), the live per-monitor behavior is a
      real-multi-display-desktop concern.
- [~] **Vulkan — DEFERRED to a later cycle (per `docs/GPU.md`).** Additive behind
      the unchanged GPU context seam (the Metal + GL rungs already prove the seam);
      Vulkan is the Linux/Android path Apple's Metal and desktop GL don't need yet,
      so it is intentionally not built this cycle. This is the one Phase-2 item that
      stays open by design — not a gap, a sequencing decision. (See the GPU-surface
      backend entry below: "Still deferred: Vulkan — additive behind the same seam,
      per the ADR.")

> **Group-opacity / `save_layer_alpha` — NOT a canvas Phase-2 item (cross-ref).**
> The opacity compositing primitive `Canvas#save_layer_alpha` ALREADY EXISTS in
> canvas (landed under "Layers" below: `sk_canvas_save_layer` with an
> alpha-carrying paint; pinned in `tests/canvas_layers.rx`). The remaining
> "opacity-op" work — exposing group opacity as an ergonomic widget mixin — is a
> QUIVER-side (L2) concern, tracked in quiver's roadmap, NOT here. Canvas's job
> (the primitive) is done; L2 owns the DSL sugar over it.

## Prod-parity Phase 3 — text i18n completion + accessibility bridge

The text-i18n follow-ups deferred out of the shaping cycle (the SHAPING.md
"deferred follow-ups" list) plus the accessibility-bridge design pass. Same
zero-ambiguity discipline as Phase 2: each item is `[x]`-with-pin or
filed-with-reason. ADRs land first per item-group (`docs/decisions/`).

### Part A — text i18n completion

- [x] **Font fallback chains (CJK / emoji)** — `Canvas#draw_text_fallback` /
      `#measure_text_fallback` / `#fallback_available?` / `#last_fallback_family`.
      **NO new dependency** — the system font manager
      (`sk_fontmgr_match_family_style_character`, Core Text on macOS) is already in
      `libSkiaSharp` (verified `nm -gU`). When the base font lacks a glyph
      (`sk_typeface_unichar_to_glyph` returns 0), the string is itemized into
      coverage runs and each uncovered run is rendered with a system-matched
      typeface via Skia's direct glyph mapping (`sk_font_unichar_to_glyph` +
      `sk_font_get_widths_bounds` → positioned textblob; no font FILE / HarfBuzz
      needed for fallback runs). CJK → PingFang/Hiragino, emoji → Apple Color
      Emoji. A process-wide fallback-typeface cache keyed by Unicode block. **Two
      binding gotchas pinned:** the per-character match SEGFAULTS with a NULL style
      (pass a normal style), and `sk_typeface_get_family_name` RETURNS an owned
      `sk_string_t*` (the buf-fill form returns empty). Pixel-pinned in
      `tests/canvas_fallback.rx` (CJK renders non-blank pixels; Latin+CJK measures
      strictly wider than the Latin prefix; fallback family reported). ADR:
      `docs/decisions/text-fallback.md`. **Scope:** CJK + emoji render;
      complex-script shaping inside a fallback font is the documented remainder.
- [x] **Color emoji** — renders through the SAME `draw_text_fallback` path (no new
      API): the fontmgr fallback reaches Apple Color Emoji, and `libSkiaSharp`
      rasterizes the color glyph table (sbix/COLR) AUTOMATICALLY when the typeface
      is a color font and the paint is a normal fill — no special color-textblob
      API needed. Pixel-pinned in `tests/canvas_color_emoji.rx`: a grinning-face
      emoji renders with MULTIPLE distinct colors AND non-white ink (the
      anti-monochrome / anti-tofu assertion — proving the color table was used, not
      a single-color outline). HONEST-SCOPE: if a future host's `libSkiaSharp`
      lacked color-table support the pin would catch it as a monochrome render and
      it would be filed; on the pinned binary it works.
- [x] **ICU segmentation (line-break + grapheme)** — **NO new dependency.** The
      system `/usr/lib/libicucore.A.dylib` is dlopen'd (it has no on-disk file —
      dyld-cache only — so the symbol check is a runtime dlsym probe, NOT `nm`); on
      this host the BARE `ubrk_*` names resolve, and the loader falls back to a
      version-suffix scan (`_70.._78`) for forward-compat. Two uses: (1)
      `Canvas#grapheme_count` / `#grapheme_boundary_at` (UTF-8 byte offsets) for
      L2's caret/selection — an emoji+ZWJ family sequence counts as ONE grapheme;
      (2) `Canvas#draw_paragraph_icu` / `#measure_paragraph_icu[_width]` — a
      paragraph wrap that breaks at ICU line-break opportunities and renders each
      line with font fallback, so CJK (no spaces) wraps at character boundaries
      instead of overflowing. `Canvas#icu_available?` probes; ICU + fallback only
      (clean Err / 0 otherwise, greedy wrap stays the fallback). Pins in
      `tests/canvas_segmentation.rx` (ASCII one-per-char; the ZWJ family emoji = 1
      grapheme; CJK = 1 per Han char; byte-offset mapping for `a中b`; a CJK
      paragraph wraps to multiple lines fitting the column). ADR:
      `docs/decisions/text-fallback.md`.
- [x] **Per-line multi-run shaping** — `Canvas#draw_text_shaped_multi` /
      `#measure_text_shaped_multi`. A line is itemized into runs by FONT COVERAGE:
      runs the base font (`font_path`) covers are HarfBuzz-shaped (kerning /
      ligatures preserved — the existing shaped path); runs it lacks (CJK / emoji)
      are rendered with the system-matched fallback typeface via Skia's direct
      glyph mapping. So a mixed Latin+CJK line shapes the Latin AND renders the CJK
      in one call. Pins in `tests/canvas_shaped_multi.rx` (Latin+CJK measures wider
      than BOTH the Latin part and the CJK part alone; a pure-Latin line still
      applies AV kerning through the covered run; a mixed line renders ink in both
      the Latin and CJK regions). The existing single-run shaped pins
      (`tests/canvas_shaping.rx`) stay green. ADR: `docs/decisions/text-fallback.md`.
      **Scope:** itemization is by font coverage; per-run SCRIPT/direction
      boundary splitting beyond coverage (and bidi reorder) is Part A item 6.
- [x] **Font / run caching** — `Canvas#shape_cache_hits` probe. Two caches:
      (a) the fallback-typeface cache keyed by Unicode block (landed with item 1),
      and (b) a NEW bounded, process-wide shaped-RUN measure cache keyed by
      (font+size+direction FNV hash) × (run-bytes FNV hash) — so re-measuring the
      same label across frames (the L2 centering case) skips HarfBuzz entirely.
      The pin ASSERTS the cache HITS on a repeat (`shape_cache_hits` rises) — a
      stable count, NOT a wall-clock perf number. Pinned in
      `tests/canvas_shape_cache.rx`. ADR: `docs/decisions/text-fallback.md`.
- [x] **bidi (RTL)** — `Canvas#draw_text_bidi` / `#measure_text_bidi` /
      `#bidi_available?`. ICU `ubidi` IS present in `libicucore` (verified), so the
      sound run-reorder landed (NOT faked): `ubidi_setPara` →
      `ubidi_countRuns` → `ubidi_getVisualRun` resolves a mixed-direction line into
      directional runs in VISUAL left-to-right order; each run is shaped with its
      resolved direction (covered runs through the shaper with the per-run
      direction, uncovered runs via fallback) and laid out left-to-right. So a
      Latin line with embedded Hebrew/Arabic renders in correct visual order. Pins
      in `tests/canvas_bidi.rx` (a Latin+Hebrew line lays out a positive width +
      ink across the line; mixed measures wider than the Latin prefix). ADR:
      `docs/decisions/text-fallback.md`. **Scope (the bounded landing):** single-LINE
      visual reordering with an LTR (auto) base level; per-line reordering of a
      WRAPPED bidi paragraph and an explicit RTL base direction are the documented
      remainder — never visually-wrong RTL (Errs cleanly when bidi is unavailable).

### Part B — accessibility bridge

- [x] **ADR + minimal sound subset** (`docs/decisions/accessibility.md`). The ADR
      fixes the L2→L1→macOS contract: L2 pushes a FLAT a11y tree (roles/labels/
      frames keyed by node id — the quiver arena idiom); L1 stores it and exposes it
      to macOS NSAccessibility via the objc runtime (the file-dialog pattern);
      updates are wholesale re-push (Tier-1); a11y is live-window-only (fork-gated,
      headless = clean unavailable). **Landed:**
      - **Engine-side intake** (`Window.push_a11y_node(id, role, label, x,y,w,h)` /
        `clear_a11y_tree` / `a11y_node_count` / `a11y_node_role` / `a11y_node_label`)
        — pure C, NO Cocoa, so it round-trips HEADLESS. Re-pushing an id REPLACES
        (wholesale re-push). This is the contract L2 codes against today.
      - **Live window touch** (`Window.a11y_available?` probe + `Window.set_a11y_title`)
        — the smallest real NSAccessibility setter (`[NSApp setAccessibilityLabel:]`)
        on a real Cocoa object through objc, fork-gated (false / Err under the
        harness, the file-dialog discipline).
      - `Window.a11y_role_*` constants (group/button/static-text/image/heading/link).
      Pins: `tests/accessibility.rx` (intake round-trips headless — push N → count
      N, role/label stored, re-push-by-id replaces, clear → 0; the
      `a11y_available?` / `set_a11y_title` contract under the forked harness — set
      succeeds iff available). Live proof: `examples/a11y_verify.c` (compiles +
      `PASS` — the NSAccessibility label round-trips through objc).
      **Staged (the ADR §4 remainder, filed with reason):** exposing the stored
      nodes as NSAccessibility CHILD elements (a custom `NSAccessibilityElement` /
      `objc_allocateClassPair` dance) + focus — its CORRECTNESS needs a live window +
      VoiceOver, which the forked harness can't run (Cocoa after fork is blocked,
      exactly like file dialogs / on-screen Metal), so it is a manual
      `examples/a11y_verify.c`-grown remainder, not automated. The automated bar
      this cycle is the headless intake pin + the probe contract.

## Prod-hardening — production-readiness closure (single-host macOS)

The pass that closes every prod-readiness gap closable on one macOS host. Same
zero-ambiguity discipline: each item is `[x]`-with-pin/proof or filed-with-reason.

- [x] **Accessibility — CHILD-element exposure + focus (finishes ADR §4).**
      `Window#sync_a11y_children` exposes the engine-side a11y store as macOS
      `NSAccessibilityElement` children on the live window's content view (reached
      via `[mtl_view window].contentView` — the ABI-safe NSView, NOT `SysWMinfo`);
      `Window#set_a11y_focus(id)` points VoiceOver focus at a node. Role enum →
      NSAccessibility role constant; frames window-point→screen (y-flip +
      `convertRectToScreen:`). Live-only/fork-gated (clean `Err` headless, pinned in
      `tests/accessibility.rx`). Live proof: the grown `examples/a11y_verify.c`
      builds a Metal window + the 3 children and ASSERTS each role+label round-trips
      via `accessibilityRole`/`accessibilityLabel`, then attempts the external AX
      client round-trip (`AXUIElementCreateApplication(getpid())`), printing a
      precise MANUAL-STEP under missing TCC consent — never a faked OS-walk
      assertion. **What a screen reader sees now:** the window is an a11y container
      (AXGroup) whose children are the pushed controls, each with role/label/screen-
      frame. **Filed remainder:** pure-raster (non-Metal) NSWindow access (the
      `SysWMinfo` path) and the OS-level VoiceOver walk (needs a live GUI session +
      consent — the human step). docs/decisions/accessibility.md §6.
- [x] **Leak soak — `examples/soak_verify.c`.** A sustained ≥10k-frame headless
      loop driving the REAL shim (compiled in, not re-implemented) through the
      leak-prone C surface: text (draw/measure, fallback+CJK, shaped) with VARYING
      strings to churn the caches, offscreen `host_snapshot` → `draw_image` → free,
      `save_layer_blur`/restore (image-filter create/unref), the event ring with
      BOTH side-channels (TextEditing marked text + FileDrop owned heap paths), and
      multi-host open/close every 500 iters. Samples RSS via mach `task_info` and
      asserts post-warmup growth < 5% (with a 2 MiB absolute floor against allocator
      noise). **Result on this host (Skia active): +0.00% over 10k iters, RSS flat
      at 28752 KB — no leak found.** `SOAK_ITERS=N` tunes the length. This catches
      the slow per-frame leak class the forked per-binding pins structurally can't.
- [x] **Error-injection pins — honest degradation proven.**
      - **(a) Missing Skia dylib:** the production loader override `RUXEN_CANVAS_SKIA`
        (already present) doubles as the fault injector — point it at a nonexistent
        path and the lazy `rx_skia()` resolves to absent. `examples/error_inject_verify.c`
        sets it (+ blanks the cache/HOME fallbacks) BEFORE the first shim call and
        asserts: `skia_available == 0`; `clear`/`draw_rect` STILL produce byte-exact
        opaque fills via software raster; a Skia-only op (`save_layer_blur`) returns
        the clean error (`-RXC_ERR_NO_SKIA == -8`, the layer family's negative-code
        convention) — never a silent no-op. **No new seam needed** (the override is
        documented + default-off).
      - **(b) GPU ladder forced failure:** already comprehensively pinned in
        `tests/gpu_backend.rx` — the forked harness IS the forced-failure environment
        (GPU rungs can't engage), and the pins assert total/safe probes, clean
        fallback with byte-exact readback, `gpu_active? ⇒ gpu_available?`, and the
        `show_gpu`/Metal ladders fall back to raster (kind 0) with correct pixels.
        Not thin — no extension required.
      - **(c) Absurd-input / integer-overflow audit:** audited every
        dimension-multiplying allocation (`host_new`'s `width*height*4`, GPU surface
        dims, glyph arrays). The per-axis cap (16384) is enforced BEFORE the multiply
        so `16384²×4 = 1 GiB` fits `size_t` — NO wrap is reachable; the defense
        already exists (no clamp added — the guard is correct). Pinned the rejection
        through `Canvas.create` (zero/negative/over-cap/gigantic/overflow-bait → Err)
        + a cap-boundary success in `tests/canvas_surface.rx`, and at the raw
        `host_new` ABI in `error_inject_verify.c`. **Audit finding: no overflow bug —
        the existing cap closes the class; pins lock it.**

## Later cycles

- Full canvas surface: `draw_path`, `draw_image`, transforms, clips, layers.
- Platform matrix: macOS/Windows/Linux → Android/iOS → web (WASM + canvas).

## Remaining — tracked checklist

Audited 2026-06-08 against `src/**`, `runtime/**`, and CHANGELOG `[Unreleased]`.
Ordered by what unblocks `quiver`'s widget library soonest. `→ ruxen #X` marks a
cross-repo dependency on a language fix (see `../ruxen/docs/TASKS.md`).

### Public-API ergonomics (ruxen language-feature adoption)

- [x] **`Window#frame` / `Canvas#frame` — resource-bracket block API** (adopts
      ruxen Ruby-blocks). `window.frame do |c: &var Canvas| … end` brackets
      begin → draw → end → present; headless windows skip present so the harness
      pins it. Blockless → explicit `Err` (never a silent frame). `examples/
      counter.rx` converted. Pins in `tests/canvas_frame.rx` + `tests/window.rx`.
- [x] **`alias` adoption** — three genuine method synonyms (`Rect#overlaps`,
      `Canvas#fill_rect`, `Canvas#line_height`), each a pure resolver synonym,
      both-name pinned. Field/`?`-name/operator alias forms are out (E1120/E1123).
- [x] **Bare string literals replace `String.from("…")`** across src/tests/
      examples (literal args only; `String.from(var)` left intact).

### Unblocked now (current language is sufficient — additive FFI, 4-step discipline)

- [x] **`draw_path` — arbitrary Skia paths** (`sk_path_*`: moveTo/lineTo/quadTo/
      cubicTo/arcTo/close, fill + stroke, fill-rule). The single highest-value
      missing primitive: it's what L2 needs for icons, custom containers, and any
      non-rect/rrect shape. Done: `Path2D` builder + `Canvas#draw_path` /
      `#stroke_path`; pin tests in `tests/canvas_path.rx`.
- [x] **Layers — `save_layer` / `save_layer_alpha`** (`sk_canvas_save_layer` /
      `sk_canvas_save_layer_alpha`): offscreen compositing for group opacity +
      blended overlays (fade transitions, translucent panels). Done:
      `Canvas#save_layer` / `#save_layer_alpha` return the layer save count and
      pair with the existing `#restore`; pin tests in `tests/canvas_layers.rx`.
- [x] **Configurable font *family*** — family selection via
      `sk_typeface_create_from_name` (+ `sk_fontstyle_*`), so widgets can pick a
      font, not just a size. Done: `Canvas#draw_text_font` / `#measure_text_font`
      / `#text_height_font`; a process-wide family cache; an unknown family
      falls back to the default typeface. Pin tests in `tests/canvas_fonts.rx`.
- [x] **Rich text — word-wrapped, aligned paragraphs** — multi-line wrapping
      labels / text blocks. The fetched `libSkiaSharp` has no SkParagraph/
      SkShaper, so wrapping is done in the shim (greedy whitespace word-wrap on
      the bound Skia font measure+draw — no new native lib). Done:
      `Canvas#draw_paragraph` (returns total height; align 0/1/2) /
      `#measure_paragraph` / `#measure_paragraph_width`; Skia-only (clean `Err`
      when absent); a long unbreakable word renders without looping. Pixel-
      verified in `tests/canvas_paragraph.rx`. **Scope: Latin word-wrap**; proper
      shaping (bidi/complex scripts) is the HarfBuzz/ICU follow-up below.
- [x] **Multi-window** — N independent on-screen windows per process
      (`docs/MULTIWINDOW.md`). The single-window globals in `runtime/sdl_window.c`
      became a fixed-size table of `RxWin` slots keyed by the owning `RxHost`; each
      `ruxen_canvas_window_*` entry point resolves its slot by `self`, so a
      single-window app touches one slot and is byte-for-byte backward compatible.
      SDL's one process-wide event queue is demuxed per `windowID` in the pump, so
      each window's input lands only in its own ring. New per-window teardown
      (`ruxen_canvas_window_destroy_for`, behind `Window#hide`). Headless pin tests
      (`tests/multiwindow.rx`: independent canvases + event rings, interleaved FIFO,
      deterministic N-window teardown); live two-window present + demux proven on a
      real display by `examples/multiwindow_verify.c` (`PASS`), not harness-
      verifiable (forked/headless harness). **Deferred:** concurrent live GL/Metal
      multi-window is architected (each slot carries its own GL/Metal state) but
      pixel-verified only for the raster path here; the GL proc-loader stays a
      process-global current-context seam (`Q-candidate`, below).

### Needs an architecture decision (design doc first, then implement)

- [~] **GPU surface backend (Ganesh)** — **decision in `docs/GPU.md`** (Metal
      on Apple, OpenGL on Linux/Windows behind one context seam, GL-first;
      Vulkan deferred). **GL backend landed** (the top rung of the
      backend-selection ladder, behind the unchanged `ruxen_canvas_*` ABI):
      - SDL GL context seam in `runtime/sdl_window.c`
        (`ruxen_canvas_window_create_gl` / `_gl_present` / `_gl_get_proc` /
        `_gl_drawable_size`), resolved in the same dlopen tier as the rest of
        SDL.
      - `GrDirectContext` + GPU-backed `SkSurface` over that GL context in
        `runtime/skia_shim.c` (`gr_glinterface_*`, `gr_direct_context_make_gl`,
        `gr_backendrendertarget_new_gl`, `sk_surface_new_backend_render_target`
        — OPTIONAL loader tier, a miss disables only the GPU rung).
      - Probes `Canvas#gpu_available?` / `#gpu_active?`; `Window#show_gpu`
        attempts GPU then falls back cleanly to the raster window path.
      - **CPU raster fallback preserved** as the test oracle; the GPU path is
        selected at runtime, never a replacement. Full GPU **pixel**
        verification is deferred to a GL-capable desktop (this host + CI are
        headless — same posture as the Skia-on-Linux-CI note in `docs/SKIA.md`);
        the smoke pin (`tests/gpu_backend.rx`) asserts the capability + clean
        fallback contract.
      - **GL-on-macOS status (with Skia now active):** `gpu_available?` is
        **true** on macOS — the Ganesh GL symbols resolve (this was previously
        blocked by a non-existent `gr_direct_context_unref` binding, now fixed to
        `gr_recording_context_unref`). A live GL **surface** still does not come
        up here because there is no SDL2 / display on this host, so `gpu_active?`
        stays false and drawing falls back cleanly. macOS GL is deprecated by
        Apple anyway — **Metal is the real Apple path**.
      - **Metal (Apple) LANDED — with headless GPU pixel verification.** The
        macOS `libSkiaSharp.dylib` is `SK_METAL=1`, so Metal is real. An
        **offscreen** Metal `SkSurface` (`gr_direct_context_make_metal` + a BGRA
        `sk_surface_new_render_target`; device+queue via `Metal.framework` + the
        objc runtime through `dlopen`) renders on the GPU with **no window**
        (`MTLCreateSystemDefaultDevice` is headless), and `sk_surface_read_pixels`
        reads the result back into the framebuffer on `end_frame` — the **first
        GPU backend pixel-verified locally**. `Canvas#enable_gpu_offscreen` is the
        no-window entry; `gpu_metal_available?` + `gpu_backend_kind == 2`
        (`RX_GPU_KIND_METAL`) report it; selection/teardown reuse the GL seam.
        Pixel proof is `examples/metal_offscreen_verify.c` (a standalone `PASS`,
        blue rect read back byte-exact) — NOT an in-harness draw, because Apple
        forbids Metal across `fork()`-without-`exec()` and the test harness forks
        per case (`MTLCompilerService` unreachable post-fork). The in-harness
        `tests/gpu_backend.rx` pins capability + clean fallback.
      - **On-screen windowed Metal (`CAMetalLayer`) LANDED.** SDL `SDL_WINDOW_METAL`
        → `SDL_Metal_CreateView`/`GetLayer` → `CAMetalLayer`; per frame acquire
        the next drawable, wrap its texture (`gr_backendrendertarget_new_metal`),
        build a per-frame `SkSurface`, draw, flush+submit, and present the
        drawable. `Window#show_gpu` ladder = on-screen Metal → GL window → raster;
        `Window#present` routes by backend. **Verified on a real display** by
        `examples/metal_window_verify.c` (`PASS`); not harness-verifiable (CF/Metal
        after `fork()` is blocked, harness forks per case → falls back to a raster
        window there). Also fixed the **host-aware SDL loader** (`load_sdl` only
        tried the Linux SO name, so macOS always fell back headless).
      - **Still deferred:** Vulkan — additive behind the same seam, per the ADR.

### Later cycles (large, sequenced)

- [~] **Text shaping / i18n** — proper shaping (kerning, ligatures, RTL/complex)
      via **HarfBuzz-direct + Skia glyph render** (`docs/SHAPING.md`). **Landed:**
      `HarfBuzzSharp.NativeAssets.macOS` fetched + SHA-pinned alongside Skia; the
      shim shapes one run (`hb_shape`) and renders the positioned glyphs with
      Skia's textblob API (libSkiaSharp has no SkParagraph/SkShaper, but DOES have
      `sk_textblob_*`). `Canvas#draw_text_shaped` / `#measure_text_shaped` /
      `#shaping_available?`; kerning + ligatures pixel-verified
      (`tests/canvas_shaping.rx`, `examples/shape_kerning_verify.c`). Plus
      **shaped paragraphs** — `Canvas#draw_paragraph_shaped` /
      `#measure_paragraph_shaped`: the greedy word-wrap now measures + renders
      each line through the shaped glyph path (a `"ffi"` line is narrower than the
      naive `f+f+i`; `tests/canvas_paragraph_shaped.rx`). **Deferred follow-ups:**
      ICU bidi / line-break / grapheme segmentation (the shaped wrap is still
      greedy-whitespace, not ICU line-break); per-line multi-run shaping + font
      fallback; family→file resolution; font/run caching. These are what "full
      international text in L2" still needs.
- [ ] **Accessibility** — platform a11y trees.
- [ ] **Platform matrix** — Windows → Android/iOS → web (WASM + canvas).

### Compiler-imposed deviations to revert (blocked on ruxen) — ALL REVERTED ✅

- [x] **`Event` coords are `Float32` again** (2026-06-09). The `Int`-logical-pixel
      workaround was reverted once ruxen **Q28** (f32 field/payload width-blind
      store) and **Q31** (enum under-allocation crashing repeated float-payload
      construction) were fixed and verified on the installed toolchain. Pointer /
      Scroll / Resize payloads are `Float32`; decode reads the C double accessors
      (`event_a`/`event_b`, newly declared) and `push_event` routes coords through
      the double `ruxen_canvas_push_event`; `KeyDown`/`TextInput` stay `Int`
      (keycode/codepoint). Sub-pixel round-trip pinned in
      `tests/subpixel_events.rx`; suite 143 green; the settings example runs a
      live windowed loop on the new decode. One residual ruxen quirk found while
      reverting — `Float32 == <negative Int literal>` miscompares (**Q33**, the
      payload value itself is correct) — worked around in one test with an
      as-Int compare.
- [x] **`measure_text` real `&String` advance width** — already the live path
      (ruxen **Q29** audit: borrowed `&String` over FFI was never broken; the
      char-count story described the legacy fallback). The dead
      `measure_text_n_raw` binding had zero callers and its Ruxen-side
      declaration is now deleted.
